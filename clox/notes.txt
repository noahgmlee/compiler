Byte Code Compiler & VM:
- Constants kind of restricted to 1-byte index for look up
  - at least at this point I cannot have more than 256 constants in a chunk
- stack based VM for tracking temporary variables
  - mimicking intermediate return values from walking an expression in an AST
  - a little less efficient that having GPRs for intermediate / temporary storage
    - (note that register based VMs do exist)
- trie for keyword / user-defined name identification
  - deterministic finite automaton (DFA), FSA, SA are abstracts that the above fits
