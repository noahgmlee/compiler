- feels like C++ with some of the smart pointers minus anything dangerous
- ownership is clear at compile time
- "shared_ptr" is a reference counted wrapper Rc
  - I am kind of abusing this in the interpreter for the shared environment lol

OOP / Interface inheritance:
- feels like Go a little bit
- implement an interface ON a struct essentially

Results:
- Rust result type very similar to verbose value, err Go syntax
- value = maybe_value_maybe_error()?; // error propagation is sytatically ez :)

Circular ref:
- lost a day to a Rc that had a circular dep
  - the underlying issue was the derived Debug print. It must be passed along with the object
  - removing it saved stack overflow
